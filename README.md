To use the gazebo simulation you need to update the gazebo version on your machine to atleast `9.14`.

For this you need to follow the `step-by-step` alternative installation method over at : http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&cat=install

Also make sure you have the dependancies download. You can make sure by using the command : `rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y `
